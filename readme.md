We can also search for all the photos related to the hashtag or user, and display them in a UICollectionView. By clicking the photo displayed, we segue to the tweet detail view.
## Project 5 demo

Use Core Data to store recent tweets, and all the mentions related to specific tweet. When clicked, we fetch the mentions related to that search history, and sort the results in descending order
